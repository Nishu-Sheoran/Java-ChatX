# Java-ChatX
A beginner-friendly Java chat project showcasing socket programming and multi-client handling.

**Java-ChatX** is a multithreaded, network-based chat application built using Java, Socket Programming, Swing GUI, and SQL Database. It allows multiple clients on different machines to communicate in real-time through a central server, with full support for user authentication, data security, and a friendly graphical interface.

## ✨ Features:



📝 User Registration & Login-

   New clients can register and create an account with a username and password.
   Existing users can log in using their credentials.
   Users can also change their password for security purposes.

💬 Real-Time Chat Between Multiple Users-

   Supports messaging between clients on different machines.
   Uses Socket Programming and Multithreading to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
   Messages are broadcasted to all connected clients in real-time.

🌐 Networking & Server Architecture-

   Single Server Socket manages multiple clients.
   Each client connects via its own Client Socket using an IP address and port number.
   Ensures seamless communication between server and clients.

🔒 Database Integration & Security-

   Stores user information securely using an SQL database.
   User data is encrypted to maintain privacy and security.

🖥️ Graphical User Interface (GUI)-

   Implemented using Swing.
   Includes visually appealing login/register screens and chat screens.
   Uses event listeners to perform various actions (e.g., sending messages, updating password).

⚠️ Exception Handling-

   All critical operations are wrapped in exception handling to prevent crashes and handle errors gracefully.

🛠️ Technologies Used:

  Java – Core language for the application logic
  Swing – For building GUI interfaces
  Socket Programming – For network communication between server and clients
  Multithreading – To handle multiple clients concurrently
  SQL Database – To store user credentials and chat information securely
  Encryption Techniques – For secure storage of user data

🏗️ How It Works:

  Server Setup-

   Start the server socket on a chosen IP and port.
   The server listens for incoming client connections.

  Client Connection-

   Clients connect to the server using the IP and port.
   New users register, while existing users log in using stored credentials.

  Messaging-

   Once connected, clients can send messages that are broadcasted to all users.
   Multithreading ensures each client can send and receive messages independently.

  Database Interaction-

   User credentials are securely stored and retrieved from the SQL database.
   Passwords can be updated for security.
